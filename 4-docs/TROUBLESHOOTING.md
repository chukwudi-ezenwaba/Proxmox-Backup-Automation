Here are some troubleshooting tips:
1. SSD not mounted
- Check device path with `lsblk`.  
- Try manually mounting:
  ```bash
  sudo mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt/external_ssd

2. VM backup fails
- Ensure there’s enough free space on the SSD.
- Try running vzdump <vmid> manually for diagnostics.

3. Cron job not running
- Verify cron logs
    ```bash
    grep proxmox_backup /var/log/syslog

4. “Permission denied” errors
- Ensure the script has execute permission
    ```bash
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/proxmox_daily_backup.sh
